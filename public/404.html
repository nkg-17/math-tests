	This HTML is opened when user tries to access nonexistent pages.
	
	This is a workaround for react-router and page refresh 
	because GitHub can not evaluate "imaginary" URL path made by react-router

	For example refreshing the page here:
		https://owner.github.io/repo/imaginary-path
	would redirect to GitHub's default 404 error page.

	So this "404.html", which is a custom 404 page for site hosted on GitHub pages, 
	redirects user to the website's root (this means returning to the home page on every refresh).

	Possible solutions:
